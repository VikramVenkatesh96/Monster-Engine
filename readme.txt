Hi Joe.
This is my final submission. It is quite bare bones with only the classes you need to pass the unit test.
I started doing all my backlog together in such a short amount of time, but am proud that I managed to complete all of them.
There are few modules I programmed that I am really proud of.
1. Heap manager with fragmentation tracking(included in FinalExam(alloc, Free and Collect))
2. Basic ECS with custom scriptable components like Unity.(1.08 and 1.09.1(working on integrating with finalExam))

I'm sorry I didn't do my earlier assignments on time because I was too focused on rapid prototyping.
I want to specialize in making procedural tools and workflows. Every prototype I have made have incorporated some type of procedural tool or workflow.
Since I am learning while creating all these tools, it took me time and hence my full concentration was on the prototypes.
